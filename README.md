# sound.xyz protocol

Explanation of our design approach:
https://sound.mirror.xyz/WlS2nfpa1Onk8uknbC7YkhVJ4cYibTc4rUDTyiR55lM

We plan to make the protocol something we maintain in coordination with the Sound community.

For the interim, this repo is primarily read-only as we build out the team and a process for
managing contributions. If you are a talented designer or engineer and are passionate about
reshaping how we value music, [please apply here](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sound.xyz).

We welcome bug or vulnerability reports. If you have one, please message us so we can discuss it
privately at dev@sound.xyz.
